* /dist should be the final build for both the server and packaged front-end

* Need to ensure the www/ folder is part of the grunt build process

* Create template html file with <section>

* Merge the react-app with the bower app

* Would like to place react [app] code in the a src/app folder

* Convert to using jspm with ES6 and Typescript  
	This will presumably also allow jspm publish to create the /dist folder

* Convert CSS to use vmin, vmax


* Combine the JS modules for JSPM to use React components
